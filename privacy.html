  <h1>Privacy Policy for Focus Booster</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong>7/02/2025</p>
  <p><strong>Focus Booster</strong> is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected by the Focus Booster Chrome extension and how that information is used.</p>
  
  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Focus Booster does not collect any personal or sensitive data. The only information stored by the Extension is a single non-personal setting (“blockerEnabled”) used to remember your preference for enabling or disabling the blocker. This data is stored locally on your device using Chrome’s storage API and is not transmitted to any external servers or third parties.</p>
  
  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>The stored setting is used solely to control the functionality of the Extension, allowing it to display a motivational screen on distracting websites when the blocker is enabled. No user data is shared, sold, or used for any other purpose.</p>
  
  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Since no personal data is collected or transmitted, the privacy risk is minimal. The local data stored by the Extension remains on your device</p>
  
  <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
  
  <h2>5. Contact Information</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact at: <a href="mailto:aayambhatt23@gmail.com">aayambhatt23@gmail.com</a></p>
